## Process
### Planning and Design
1. **Research and Inspiration**: I started by analyzing other successful web design portfolios to identify effective layouts, typography, and visual styles.
2. **Wireframing**: I sketched wireframes for each page, focusing on user navigation, responsive design, and content hierarchy.
3. **Prototyping**: I used tools like Figma to create high-fidelity prototypes, ensuring consistency in design elements across all devices.

### Development
1. **HTML and CSS**: I structured the pages using semantic HTML5 and styled them with custom CSS3.
2. **Responsive Design**: Media queries were utilized to ensure the design adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
3. **Testing**: I tested the website on multiple devices and browsers to identify and resolve layout or functionality issues.
